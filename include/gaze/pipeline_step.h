/**
 * @class PipelineStep pipeline_step.h "gaze/pipeline_step.h"
 * @brief Abstract base class for PipelineSteps. Must be inherited from.
 *
 * When initializing a gaze::Pipeline, each step is put into its own thread.
 * They can communicate via an input and an output deque.
 *
 * Custom PipelineSteps must implement their own process(util::Data* data)
 * method. They should only add data to fields which were not written before.
 *
 * Custom PipelineSteps may implement their own get_data() and store_data()
 * functions. This is especially important for the first and last step in
 * a Pipeline: The first should ignore its input deque and create data objects
 * instead (inside the get_data() method), the last step should not store
 * its results to a final deque, but instead write to disk or similar. This may
 * be different if there are steps outside of the pipeline which provide data
 * or store it.
