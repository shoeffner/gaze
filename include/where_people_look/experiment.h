/**
 * @class Experiment experiment.h "where_people_look/experiment.h"
 *
 * @brief Implements an experiment flow for Judd et al. (2009) \cite judd2009.
 *
 * The data acquisition experiment can be prepared, started, quitted, and
 * is divided into trials.
 *
 * @par Using this class
 *
 * The experiment should first be prepared (prepare()), then
 * started (start()). After that, it will go through each available
 * trial, recalibrate every 50 trials, and stop after all trials are done.
 *
 * Each trial lasts three seconds and there are pauses of one second between
 * the trials, during which a gray screen is shown.
 *
 * Before the first and after the last trial there is another two seconds
 * break.
 *
 * @note
 * Many static functions are just created to allow G_CALLBACK to call them
 * with appropriate Experiment instances. For example,
 * Experiment::experiment_trial calls trial()
 * on the provided experiment. However, some do extra checking:
 * Experiment::experiment_start will only start the experiment if the space key
 * was pressed and the experiment is not yet running.
