  abstract  = {For many applications in graphics, design, and human computer interaction, it is essential to understand where humans look in a scene. Where eye tracking devices are not a viable option, models of saliency can be used to predict fixation locations. Most saliency approaches are based on bottom-up computation that does not consider top-down image semantics and often does not match actual eye movements. To address this problem, we collected eye tracking data of 15 viewers on 1003 images and use this database as training and testing examples to learn a model of saliency based on low, middle and high-level image features. This large database of eye tracking data is publicly available with this paper.},

  abstract     = {The estimation of the eye centres is used in several computer vision applications such as face recognition or eye tracking. Especially for the latter, systems that are remote and rely on available light have become very popular and several methods for accurate eye centre localisation have been proposed. Nevertheless, these methods often fail to accurately estimate the eye centres in difficult scenarios, e.g. low resolution, low contrast, or occlusions. We therefore propose an approach for accurate and robust eye centre localisation by using image gradients. We derive a simple objective function, which only consists of dot products. The maximum of this function corresponds to the location where most gradient vectors intersect and thus to the eye's centre. Although simple, our method is invariant to changes in scale, pose, contrast and variations in illumination. We extensively evaluate our method on the very challenging BioID database for eye centre and iris localisation. Moreover, we compare our method with a wide range of state of the art methods and demonstrate that our method yields a significant improvement regarding both accuracy and robustness.},
