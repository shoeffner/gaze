    <h1>Gaze documentation</h1>
    <p>This is the documentation for <a href="https://github.com/shoeffner/gaze">Gaze</a>,
    a master's thesis project by <a href="https://sebastian-hoeffner.de/">Sebastian H&ouml;ffner</a>.</p>

    <h2>About and warning</h2>
    <p>Gaze is a library aimed at calibration free gaze tracking using normal
    webcams. However, it does not work properly. It might (but more likely
    might not) work in the future, but due to the nature of thesis projects I
    will most likely not pick it up anytime soon after I submitted my thesis.</p>
    <p>If you are still interested in using it or developing it further, you
    should be able to find all relevant information in my
    <a href="https://github.com/shoeffner/mthesis">thesis</a>, the
    <a href="latest">documentation</a>, the
    <a href="https://github.com/shoeffner/gaze">source code</a>, or by
    <a href="mailto:shoeffner@uos.de">dropping me a line</a>.</p>

    <h2>Version Documentation</h2>
    <p>Gaze provides documentation for different versions, and the current
    master branch tip. Additionally, there is a <a href="gaze.tag">Doxygen tag
    file</a> available, which matches the latest version.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="latest">latest version</a> (HEAD of master branch)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final note</h2>
    <p>While the gaze tracking capabilities are very limited, the project still
    explores various exciting software developing practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using Git for version control</li>
        <li>Setting up <a href="https://github.com/shoeffner/gaze">GitHub</a> and
            <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/hoeffner/gaze">Semaphore CI</a> for automated building, testing, and
            <a href="">documentation deployment (this page you are viewing)</a></li>
        <li>Modularized C++ code</li>
        <li>"modern" CMake, i.e. <pre>target_link_libraries(project gaze::gaze)</pre> is
            (<a href="https://github.com/shoeffner/mthesis/tree/master/assets/examples/simple_gaze_caller/CMakeLists.txt">almost</a>)
            sufficient to use gaze</li>
        <li>Example programs</li>
        <li>Well documented</li>
        <li>Free and Open Source Software</li>
    </ul>
